## Uyghur
We collect 1000 sentences from the [TianshanNet](http://uy.ts.cn/)  web site, and manually annotated them with NEs. The sentences are extracted from overseas, domestic and Xinjiang news articles.

The Uyghur repository consists of necessary dictionaries, sentences for training, sentences for testing and manually annotated named entities.
